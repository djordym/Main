The Chinese money plant (Pilea peperomioides) is an eye-catching, easy-to-care-for houseplant native to the Yunnan Province of China. Also known as the pancake plant or UFO plant, this attractive plant features coin-shaped, deep green leaves that grow on long, slender stems, giving it a unique, modern appearance.

Watering: Chinese money plants prefer a consistent watering schedule. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings, then water thoroughly until water drains from the bottom of the pot. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so be cautious not to let the plant sit in standing water.

Light: These plants thrive in bright, indirect light. Place your Chinese money plant near a south or east-facing window with filtered sunlight. Too much direct sun can cause leaf scorching, while too little light can lead to leggy growth.

Humidity/Misting: Chinese money plants can adapt to a wide range of humidity levels but prefer moderate humidity. To maintain adequate humidity, place the plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water or use a humidifier. Misting is not necessary but can be done occasionally to help clean the leaves and maintain humidity.

Drainage/Soil: Proper drainage is essential for a healthy Chinese money plant. Use a well-draining, all-purpose potting mix, and ensure your pot has drainage holes. Check the soil regularly for moisture levels, and adjust your watering routine accordingly to prevent waterlogged or overly dry conditions.
