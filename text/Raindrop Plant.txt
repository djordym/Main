The Raindrop Plant (Peperomia polybotrya) is an attractive, low-maintenance houseplant native to Central and South America. This compact plant features thick, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface resembling raindrops, hence its name. The leaves are typically deep green, and the plant can produce small, non-showy, greenish-white flower spikes.

Watering: Raindrop Plants prefer moderate watering, allowing the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Water the plant thoroughly until water drains from the bottom of the pot. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so be cautious not to let the plant sit in standing water.

Light: These plants thrive in bright, indirect light. A north or east-facing window is ideal, as direct sunlight can scorch the leaves. They can tolerate low light conditions but may grow more slowly and have less vibrant foliage.

Humidity/Misting: Raindrop Plants prefer moderate humidity levels but can adapt to a wide range of household humidity conditions. You can increase the humidity around the plant by placing it on a tray with pebbles and water or by using a humidifier. Misting the leaves occasionally can also help maintain humidity, but it is not essential.

Drainage/Soil: Good drainage is critical for a healthy Raindrop Plant. Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix, and ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil. Regularly check the soil for moisture and adjust your watering frequency to maintain optimal soil moisture levels.
