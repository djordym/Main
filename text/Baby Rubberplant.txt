The baby rubber plant (Peperomia obtusifolia) is a popular, compact houseplant native to Central and South America. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves with a glossy finish, which resemble those of a rubber tree. The plant's low-maintenance nature and attractive appearance make it a favorite among indoor gardeners.

Watering: Baby rubber plants require moderate watering, with a preference for slightly moist soil. Water the plant thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.

Light: These plants thrive in bright, indirect light. A north or east-facing window is ideal, as direct sunlight can scorch the leaves. They can tolerate low light conditions but may grow more slowly.

Humidity/Misting: Baby rubber plants prefer moderate humidity levels. You can increase the humidity around the plant by placing it on a tray with pebbles and water or by using a humidifier. Misting the leaves occasionally can also help maintain humidity, but it is not essential.

Drainage/Soil: Good drainage is critical for a healthy baby rubber plant. Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix, and ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil. Regularly check the soil for moisture, and adjust watering frequency to maintain optimal soil moisture levels.
