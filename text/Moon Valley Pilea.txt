Moon Valley Pilea (Pilea involucrata), also known as Friendship Plant, is an attractive, low-growing, tropical houseplant native to Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its textured, deep-green leaves with prominent veins, often featuring a reddish or purplish hue on the undersides. The leaves have a crinkled appearance, resembling the uneven surface of the moon, which gives the plant its name.

Watering: Moon Valley Pilea prefers consistently moist soil, but it should not be soggy. Water the plant thoroughly when the top inch of soil starts to dry out. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so be cautious not to let the plant sit in standing water.

Light: This plant thrives in bright, indirect light or filtered sunlight. A north or east-facing window is ideal, as direct sunlight can scorch the leaves. It can tolerate low light conditions, but its growth may be slower and the foliage coloration may be less vibrant.

Humidity/Misting: Moon Valley Pilea prefers high humidity levels, which mimic its natural rainforest habitat. To maintain adequate humidity, place the plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water or use a humidifier. Misting the leaves regularly can also help keep the plant hydrated and maintain humidity.

Drainage/Soil: Proper drainage is essential for a healthy Moon Valley Pilea. Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix, and ensure your pot has drainage holes. Check the soil regularly for moisture levels and adjust your watering routine accordingly to prevent waterlogged or overly dry conditions.

Note: Moon Valley Pilea is non-toxic to humans and pets, making it a safe addition to households with children or animals.
