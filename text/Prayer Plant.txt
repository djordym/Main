The Prayer Plant (Maranta leuconeura) is a popular, eye-catching houseplant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. Known for its striking foliage, the plant features oval leaves with intricate vein patterns in shades of green, red, and cream. The Prayer Plant gets its name from the unique way its leaves fold up at night, resembling hands in prayer.

Watering: Prayer Plants prefer consistently moist soil. Water the plant thoroughly when the top inch of soil begins to dry out, ensuring that the water drains freely from the bottom. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so avoid letting the plant sit in standing water.

Light: This plant thrives in bright, indirect light or filtered sunlight. A north or east-facing window is ideal, as direct sunlight can scorch the leaves. It can tolerate lower light conditions but may exhibit slower growth and less vibrant foliage.

Humidity/Misting: Prayer Plants prefer high humidity levels, similar to their native rainforest environment. To maintain adequate humidity, place the plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water or use a humidifier. Misting the leaves regularly can also help keep the plant hydrated and maintain humidity.

Drainage/Soil: Proper drainage is essential for a healthy Prayer Plant. Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix, and ensure your pot has drainage holes. Check the soil regularly for moisture levels and adjust your watering routine accordingly to prevent waterlogged or overly dry conditions.

Temperature: Prayer Plants prefer temperatures between 65째F and 75째F (18째C - 24째C) during the day and slightly cooler temperatures at night. Avoid exposing the plant to drafts, as it is sensitive to sudden temperature fluctuations.
