Devil's Vine (Epipremnum aureum), commonly known as Golden Pothos, Pothos, or Money Plant, is a popular, low-maintenance houseplant native to the Solomon Islands. Its trailing vines feature heart-shaped, glossy leaves with variegated patterns of green and yellow or cream. This versatile plant is known for its air-purifying qualities and ability to adapt to various growing conditions.

Watering: Devil's Vine is relatively drought-tolerant, requiring moderate watering. Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings, then water thoroughly. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so be sure not to let the plant sit in standing water.

Light: This plant thrives in a range of light conditions, from bright, indirect light to low light areas. However, the variegation on the leaves will be more pronounced in brighter light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.

Humidity/Misting: Devil's Vine can tolerate average household humidity levels but may benefit from slightly higher humidity. You can place the plant on a tray with pebbles and water or use a humidifier to maintain humidity. Misting the leaves occasionally can also help, but it is not a requirement.

Drainage/Soil: Proper drainage is essential for a healthy Devil's Vine. Use a well-draining, all-purpose potting mix, and ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil. Regularly check the soil for moisture and adjust your watering routine as needed to maintain optimal soil conditions.
