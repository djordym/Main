Euphorbia lactea 'Cristata', also known as the Crested Elkhorn or Coral Cactus, is a visually striking, slow-growing, grafted cactus-like succulent. This unique plant is a combination of two different succulents: the Euphorbia lactea crest, which forms the wavy, fan-shaped top, and the Euphorbia neriifolia, which serves as the rootstock. The plant's crested top features irregular, undulating growth patterns in shades of green, with some varieties displaying hints of white, pink, or purple.

Watering: Euphorbia lactea 'Cristata' requires infrequent watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, and then water thoroughly. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's essential to avoid keeping the soil consistently moist.

Light: This plant thrives in bright, indirect light or partial shade. A south, east, or west-facing window with filtered sunlight is ideal. Direct sunlight can cause sunburn on the leaves, while insufficient light may result in poor growth and coloration.

Humidity/Misting: Euphorbia lactea 'Cristata' does not require high humidity levels, as it is adapted to arid environments. Misting is generally unnecessary and can potentially lead to fungal infections or other issues if the plant remains damp for extended periods.

Drainage/Soil: Proper drainage is crucial for the health of Euphorbia lactea 'Cristata'. Use a well-draining, cactus-specific or succulent potting mix, and ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil. Monitor the soil's moisture levels and adjust your watering schedule as needed to maintain the ideal balance between dry and moist conditions.

Note: Euphorbia lactea 'Cristata' contains a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin and eyes, so it's important to handle the plant with care and keep it out of reach of children and pets.
