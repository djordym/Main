Rex Begonia (Begonia rex-cultorum) is a popular houseplant known for its stunning foliage, featuring a wide variety of colors, patterns, and textures. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, Rex Begonias display large, heart-shaped leaves that can exhibit vibrant shades of red, pink, silver, green, and purple. The plant's striking appearance makes it a great addition to indoor spaces and terrariums.

Watering: Rex Begonias prefer consistent moisture but should not be overwatered, as this can lead to root rot. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering the plant thoroughly. It's essential to avoid wetting the leaves, as this can cause mildew and other fungal diseases.

Light: These plants thrive in bright, indirect light or filtered sunlight. A north or east-facing window is ideal, as direct sunlight can scorch the leaves. Rex Begonias can tolerate lower light conditions, but their growth may be slower, and the foliage coloration may be less vibrant.

Humidity/Misting: Rex Begonias prefer high humidity levels, which mimic their natural rainforest environment. To maintain adequate humidity, place the plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water or use a humidifier. Misting is not recommended for Rex Begonias, as it can promote the growth of mold and mildew on the leaves.

Drainage/Soil: Proper drainage is essential for a healthy Rex Begonia. Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix, and ensure your pot has drainage holes. Check the soil regularly for moisture levels and adjust your watering routine accordingly to prevent waterlogged or overly dry conditions.

Temperature: Rex Begonias prefer temperatures between 65째F and 75째F (18째C - 24째C) during the day and slightly cooler temperatures at night. They are sensitive to drafts and sudden temperature fluctuations, so it's essential to keep them away from heating and cooling vents or drafty windows.
