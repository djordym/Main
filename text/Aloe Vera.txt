Aloe vera is a succulent plant known for its fleshy, spiky leaves that contain a gel with numerous medicinal and skincare properties. It's a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to purify the air.

Watering: Water your aloe vera plant deeply, but infrequently. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, usually every 2-3 weeks, depending on the season and the pot size. Overwatering can cause root rot, which can be detrimental to the plant's health.

Light: Aloe vera prefers bright, indirect sunlight. Place it near a sunny window, but avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves. Providing 6-8 hours of bright, indirect light per day is ideal.

Humidity/Misting: Aloe vera plants do well in average room humidity levels (40-60%). They do not require misting, as they are adapted to arid environments. Excessive humidity can cause fungal issues.

Drainage/Soil: Aloe vera plants require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. A cactus or succulent potting mix works well. Make sure to plant it in a pot with drainage holes to allow excess water to escape easily.
